Features
--------
The widget is in development and has currently basic features such as CZML and KML.

The vision is to have a widget for representing orbits,
geo-related informations in an efficient way directly in the browser. By using the full
screen button, the widget can be expanded to provide a larger view.

Roadmap still to be written but visioned features are:
* Time readout and control of widget from python
* Better interface with czml
* Pyplot-like interface to quickly plot stuff
* GeoJSON mapping
